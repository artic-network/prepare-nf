# prepare-nf
Generate a run sample sheet to input to amplicon-nf

This workflow is primarily designed to be run via a GUI such as EPI2ME.

If you want to run on the command line

Required arguments are:
- run_dir - the directory where reads have been generated by the sequencer e.g. for ONT this will be a directory containing a subdirectory of fastq for each barcode
- platform - currently only supports "ont"/"nanopore"
- metadata - a CSV or XLS file containing barcode and sample columns
- amplicon_scheme - either a primal-scheme name in the format `<name>/<length>/<version>` or a custom scheme name (with `--custom_scheme_path` also provided)

Example command:
```
nextflow run artic-network/prepare-nf --platform ont --run_dir test --metadata test/samplesheet.csv --amplicon_scheme custom/3000/v1.0.0
```
